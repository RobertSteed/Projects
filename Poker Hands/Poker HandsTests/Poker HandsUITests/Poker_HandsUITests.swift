/// determineWinner will take in an array of "Poker" hands and determine which hand is better (according to texas holdem rules).
/// Traditionally in Texas Holdem you are only given 2 cards and then 5 other cards are placed flipped up in front of everyone.
/// In our version each player is given 5 cards with no cards placed on the table.
/// Based on just the 5 cards given in a hand. You are to determine what type of winning hands a player has and which is best.
/// For example a player may have a 2 of a kind and a 3 of a kind in a single hand. 3 of a kind is better than 2 of a kind and should be used to determine if their hand is better than any of the other players hands.
///
/// - Returns: Hand - Which is the hand that won. It is expected that the handType property("2 of a kind", "3 of a kind", "4 of a kind", etc) will have a value when returning the winning hand.
///
///
///

/// Have a function that figures out what hand somebody has. Then put the value of the hand into determining the winner
